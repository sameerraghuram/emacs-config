# emacs-config

My emacs configuration, at it's current state, is a jumble of bits and pieces of other configurations I have sourced on the internet.
This config is geared towards python development. With the following modules installed from the melpa archive.
- auto-complete
- elpy
- py-autopep8
- material-theme

I have mentioned the guides I used to get this up and running down below. They do a much better job of explaining what is happening in
the code.
