# emacs-config

My emacs configuration, at it's current state, is a jumble of bits and pieces of other configurations I have scoured on the internet.
This config is geared towards python development. With the following modules installed from the melpa archive.
- auto-complete
- elpy
- py-autopep8
- material-theme

I have mentioned the guides I used to get this up and running down below. They do a much better job of explaining what is happening in
the code. 

I am not close to being an emacs power-user yet, I am still struggling with the rather steep learning curve. But I soldier on, 
in hopes that once I get my bearings and a grasp of how to customize emacs to suit my style of development, I will have a much more 
coherent and useful config which could (hopefully) help others with their config.
